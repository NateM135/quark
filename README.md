# quirk
A fix for the Quirk GUI not opening upon double clicking the application. 


Quirk is used with Goldleaf to install .NSP files onto a Nintendo Switch while bypassing the Fat32 4gb file limit. For some people, Quirk will not open upon double-clicking the jar file. This batch file will fix that issue. 

Directions:
1) Download Batch File
2) Place Into the directory that has Quirk.jar
3) Double click the batch file.

If you did the directions properly, the quirk GUI should now be open on your computer.
